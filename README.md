# Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) with Minimax
This is the project I undertook during my A Levels: a simple noughts and crosses game with a Tkinter GUI, but with the addition of the minimax algorithm. The result of this is an AI opponent that cannot be beaten, as it always chooses the best possible move.
